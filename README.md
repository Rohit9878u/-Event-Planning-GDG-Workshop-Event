## Event Title

**Building with APIs: Hands-on Workshop for Students**

## Objective of the Event

* Teach students how to build a small, useful application by integrating public APIs and good developer practices.
* Provide hands-on mentorship so attendees leave with a working prototype and next-step resources.
* Grow the campus GDG community and connect students with local developer mentors and employers.

## Target Audience

* Undergraduate & postgraduate students studying CS, IT, Electronics, or related fields.
* Early-career developers and hobbyists who want practical API/building experience.

## Expected Turnout

* **Target:** 60–120 participants.
* **Breakdown:** 40% beginners, 40% intermediate, 20% advanced (mentors/helpers).

## Venue Options

1. **Auditorium / Lecture Hall** (recommended) — projector, auditorium seating, strong Wi‑Fi.
2. **Computer Lab** — ideal if each attendee needs a PC (limited capacity).
3. **Hybrid: Lecture Hall + Breakout Rooms** — lecture + hands-on in smaller groups.

> Choose based on expected turnout and availability of power + internet.

## Risk & Contingency Plan

* **Wi‑Fi outage:** switch to mobile hotspots, reduce media-heavy tasks, or pre-record demos
* **Speaker cancellation:** have a backup talk or step-up mentor-run session
* **Low turnout:** run a smaller cohort, or convert to more hands-on mentor time
* **High turnout (overcapacity):** implement a waitlist and move hands-on to breakout rooms

### Simple `README.md` snippet for the repo (ready to copy)

```
# GDG Workshop: Building with APIs
This repository contains the execution plan, starter code and promotional assets for the campus GDG workshop.

- See `starter-repo/` for the hands-on code.
- See `docs/runbook.md` for the day-of runbook and volunteer instructions.
```

## How to use this file on GitHub (quick steps)

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `gdg-workshop-execution-plan`.
2. Add this document as `README.md`.
3. Create the `starter-repo/`, `assets/`, and `docs/` folders and populate them.
4. Share the repo link in the GDG event page and in your promotional posts.

If you want, I can also:

* generate the `starter-repo/README.md` starter code scaffold (JS/React or Node example),
* produce `docs/runbook.md` in detail for volunteers,
* create social media post text and a poster layout (editable).

Pick one and I'll add it into the repository content as a second file.
